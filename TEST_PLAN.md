## Test Implementation Guide

### Creating New Tests
1. Use the existing test structure in `tests/` directory
2. Import helpers from `test-helpers.js`
3. Follow naming convention: `feature.test.js`
4. Group related tests with `test.describe()`

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npx playwright test

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/main-site/pages.test.js

# Run with UI mode for debugging
npx playwright test --ui

# Run specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium
```

### Test Data Management
- Use fixtures in `test-helpers.js` for consistent test data
- Clean up test data after each test
- Use unique identifiers to avoid conflicts

## Success Criteria
- All tests pass on CI/CD pipeline
- No flaky tests (tests that randomly fail)
- Test execution time < 5 minutes
- Code coverage > 80%
- All critical user paths tested

## Next Steps
1. Implement page content tests (Phase 2)
2. Fix remaining browser-specific issues
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
4. Create dashboard for test results
5. Schedule regular test runs
