  - paragraph: Permanent supportive housing (PSH) is subsidized, leased housing with no limit on length of stay that prioritizes people who need comprehensive support services to retain tenancy. PSH utilizes admissions practices designed to use lower barriers to entry than would be typical for other subsidized or unsubsidized rental housing, especially related to rental history, criminal history, and personal behaviors.
  - paragraph: PSH is paired with on-site or off-site voluntary services designed to support a person living with a complex and disabling behavioral health or physical health condition who was experiencing homelessness or was at imminent risk of homelessness prior to moving into housing.
  - paragraph: The goal is to help residents retain their housing, be successful tenants, improve their health status, and connect with community-based health care, treatment, or employment services.
