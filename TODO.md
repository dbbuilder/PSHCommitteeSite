## ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE PRIORITY - Test Results & Fixes

### âœ… Phase 1: Hamburger Navigation Status
**GOOD NEWS: The hamburger menu is working correctly!**
- [x] Header already has `relative` positioning
- [x] Mobile menu has proper z-index (z-50)
- [x] Menu has smooth transition animations
- [x] Menu closes when clicking outside (works on most browsers)
- [x] Menu toggle functionality works well
- [ ] Safari-specific issue: Menu doesn't close after navigation
- [ ] Edge mobile viewport: Hamburger button not visible
### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues Found (From Test Results - June 25, 2025)
- [ ] **Blog Page Title Mismatch**: Page shows "News & Updates" instead of "Blog"
  - All navigation tests failing due to this content issue
  - Fix: Update page heading in `/pages/blog/index.js` to match expected "Blog"
- [ ] **Active Page Detection**: Test expects exact class matching but hover states interfere
  - Fix: Update navigation tests to check for specific active state classes

### ðŸ”´ Homepage Content Mismatch (From Test Results - June 25, 2025)
- [ ] **Homepage Heading**: Shows "Permanent Supportive Housing Advisory Committee" but tests expect "Washington State PSH Advisory Committee"
- [ ] **Missing Homepage Sections**: Tests expect these sections but they don't exist:
  - [ ] "Our Mission" section
  - [ ] "About the Committee" section with "Meet Our Members" link
  - [ ] "Recent Updates" section with "View All Updates" link
  - [ ] "Resources" section with "Browse Resources" link
  - [ ] "Get in Touch" contact section with email link
- [ ] **Existing Homepage Sections** (not tested):
  - Quick Stats section (26 members, 122,000 units needed, etc.)
  - What is PSH section
  - Upcoming Events section (âœ… working correctly)
- [ ] **Decision Required**: Either update homepage to match tests OR update tests to match current homepage design
- [ ] **Mobile Safari**: Menu doesn't close after navigation
  - Add Safari-specific event handling in Header.js
  - Ensure route change listener works on Safari
- [ ] **Microsoft Edge Mobile**: Hamburger button not visible on mobile viewport
  - Check CSS media queries for Edge compatibility
  - Test responsive breakpoints on Edge
- [ ] **Firefox Performance**: Multiple tests timing out
  - Investigate page load performance on Firefox
  - Consider increasing test timeouts for Firefox
- [ ] **Mobile Safari Keyboard**: Focus indicators not visible
  - Add explicit `:focus` styles for mobile Safari

### Phase 2: Playwright Testing Status âœ…
- [x] Playwright already installed and configured
- [x] Test directory structure created
- [x] Navigation tests written and executed
- [x] Test helpers and utilities in place

#### ðŸš§ In Progress - Browser-Specific Fixes

  ```
