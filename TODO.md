- All sensitive configuration should be in environment variables
- The site is designed to be fully static with API routes for dynamic features
- Contact form submissions are stored as JSON files for simplicity

## üêõ Known Issues

1. **Homepage 404 Error**: The development server is returning 404 for the root path. This needs to be investigated - could be related to:
   - Next.js routing configuration
   - Development server cache
   - Missing index.js export
   
2. **ESLint Not Installed**: Build process requires ESLint to be installed as a dev dependency

## üîß Quick Fixes

```bash
# Install ESLint
cd d:\dev2\pshcommitteesite
npm install --save-dev eslint

# Clear Next.js cache and rebuild
rm -rf .next
npm run dev

# If homepage still shows 404, check:
# - pages/index.js exports default component
# - No middleware blocking root path
# - No conflicting routes
```
