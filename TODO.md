## ðŸ”„ In Progress / Next Steps

### Fixed: Dashboard Real-time Counts
- **Problem**: Dashboard showing hardcoded placeholder values (12, 8, 45, 7)
- **Solution**: Updated to fetch real counts from API endpoints
- **Files**: `/pages/admin/dashboard.js`

### Fixed: Blob Storage Warning
- **Problem**: Warning showing even when blob storage was configured
- **Solution**: Removed incorrect client-side environment variable check
- **Files**: `/pages/admin/documents.js`

## ðŸ”§ FIXED - Document Upload Error (June 25, 2025)

### Issue: 500 Internal Server Error on Document Upload
- **Problems**: 
  1. Upload endpoint returned 500 error with "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'success')"
  2. Authentication verification was using wrong function signature
- **Root Causes**: 
  1. Dynamic import of '@vercel/blob' was failing in production
  2. `verifyToken(req)` pattern didn't match actual function signature
- **Solutions**: 
  - Updated `/pages/api/admin/upload.js` to use existing `uploadFileToBlob` function
  - Added comprehensive error handling and CORS headers
  - Created `verifyAdminAuth(req)` function to properly verify authentication
  - Updated all admin endpoints to use consistent auth pattern
- **Test Tools Created**: 
  - `/scripts/test-upload.js` - Node.js test script
  - `/public/upload-test.html` - Browser test page
  - `/public/upload-test-v2.html` - Enhanced test page with debugging
- **Documentation**: 
  - `UPLOAD_FIX.md` - Initial upload fix details
  - `AUTH_FIX_COMPLETE.md` - Authentication fix details
  - `CORRECT_PASSWORD.md` - Correct login credentials

## âœ… COMPLETED - Vercel Blob Storage Migration (June 25, 2025)

  - [x] Maintained existing blog.json structure for compatibility
- [x] Updated `/pages/api/admin/blog.js` to use blob storage
  - [x] Replaced file system operations with blob storage calls
  - [x] Kept same API interface for backward compatibility
  - [x] Added initialization for blob storage
- [x] Updated `/pages/api/blog.js` (public API) to use blob storage

## ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE PRIORITY - Test Results & Fixes

### âœ… Phase 1: Hamburger Navigation Status
**GOOD NEWS: The hamburger menu is working correctly!**
- [x] Header already has `relative` positioning
- [x] Mobile menu has proper z-index (z-50)
- [x] Menu has smooth transition animations
- [x] Menu closes when clicking outside (works on most browsers)
- [x] Menu toggle functionality works well

  - All navigation tests failing due to this content issue
  - Fix: Update page heading in `/pages/blog/index.js` to match expected "Blog"
- [ ] **Active Page Detection**: Test expects exact class matching but hover states interfere
  - Fix: Update navigation tests to check for specific active state classes

### ðŸ”´ Homepage Content Mismatch (From Test Results - June 25, 2025)
- [ ] **Homepage Heading**: Shows "Permanent Supportive Housing Advisory Committee" but tests expect "Washington State PSH Advisory Committee"

  - Quick Stats section (26 members, 122,000 units needed, etc.)
  - What is PSH section
  - Upcoming Events section (âœ… working correctly)
- [ ] **Decision Required**: Either update homepage to match tests OR update tests to match current homepage design
- [ ] **Mobile Safari**: Menu doesn't close after navigation
  - Add Safari-specific event handling in Header.js
  - Ensure route change listener works on Safari
- [ ] **Microsoft Edge Mobile**: Hamburger button not visible on mobile viewport
