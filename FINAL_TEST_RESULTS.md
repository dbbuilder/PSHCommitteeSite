## Root Cause Analysis

### Mobile Menu Issues
The mobile menu close behavior appears to be related to:
1. The hamburger button click handler may need debouncing
2. Route change events might not be firing consistently on all mobile browsers
3. Touch events vs click events on mobile devices

### Recommended Fixes

1. **Mobile Menu Toggle** - Add explicit state check:
```javascript
onClick={() => setIsMenuOpen(prev => !prev)}
```

2. **Route Change Handler** - Add more event listeners:
```javascript
router.events.on('routeChangeError', handleRouteChange)
router.events.on('hashChangeComplete', handleRouteChange)
```

3. **Click Outside** - Improve touch event handling:
```javascript
document.addEventListener('touchend', handleClickOutside)
```

## Action Items Priority

### 🔴 High Priority (Affects User Experience)
1. Fix mobile menu toggle behavior
2. Ensure menu closes after navigation on all mobile browsers
3. Add debouncing to hamburger button clicks

### 🟡 Medium Priority (Minor Issues)
1. Improve Safari keyboard navigation support
2. Fix test design for mobile viewport navigation tests

### 🟢 Low Priority (Test Infrastructure)
1. Investigate Firefox WebDriver stability
2. Optimize test execution time

## Conclusion

The site is in excellent shape with a 90.7% test pass rate. The main remaining issue is the mobile menu behavior on some browsers, which is a common challenge with mobile web development. The fixes are straightforward and once implemented, we should achieve near 100% pass rate.

### Next Steps
1. Implement the mobile menu fixes
2. Re-run tests to verify fixes
3. Deploy to production with confidence
4. Set up continuous integration to run tests automatically
