# Documents Feature Implementation

## Overview
The documents feature has been successfully implemented for the PSH Committee Site. This feature allows administrators to manage documents and users to view/download them.

## Components Created

### Admin Pages
1. **`/admin/documents`** - Main documents management page
   - View all documents with metadata
   - Search and filter by category
   - Edit document details
   - Delete documents (metadata only, files remain)
   - Link to upload page

2. **`/admin/documents/upload`** - Document upload page
   - Upload new documents
   - Auto-populate title from filename
   - Select category
   - Add description
   - File validation (PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Text)

### Public Pages
1. **`/documents`** - Public documents page
   - Browse all available documents
   - Search by title or description
   - Filter by category
   - Download documents
   - Responsive card layout

### API Endpoints
1. **`/api/admin/documents`** - Admin documents API
   - GET: Fetch all documents with admin details
   - POST: Create new document record
   - PUT: Update document metadata
   - DELETE: Remove document record

2. **`/api/admin/upload`** - File upload handler
   - POST: Handle file uploads (currently simulated)
   - Validates file types
   - Returns file metadata

3. **`/api/documents`** - Public documents API
   - GET: Fetch all available documents
   - Filters out documents with missing files

### Data Structure
- **`data/documents.json`** - Documents metadata storage
  ```json
  {
    "id": "string",
    "title": "string",
    "filename": "string",
    "description": "string",
    "category": "string",
    "uploadedAt": "ISO date string",
    "fileSize": "string",
    "downloadCount": "number"
  }
  ```

## Categories
- Reports
- Legislation  
- Guidelines
- Factsheets
- Governance
- Meeting Minutes
- Presentations

- Resources

## Existing Documents
The following PDF documents are already available in `/public/documents/`:
1. Commerce Reports 2023 HD PSH Advisory Committee Final
2. PSH 101 Factsheet
3. Bill 1724-S.sl
4. RCW 36.70A.030
5. RCW 43.330.425
6. Implementing Housing First in Permanent Supportive Housing
7. All-in Report - Page 45

## Navigation
- Added "Documents" link to main navigation menu (between Blog and Resources)

## Security
- Admin endpoints require authentication via JWT token
- Public endpoints are accessible without authentication
- File upload validation prevents unauthorized file types

## Next Steps

### Required for Full Functionality
1. **Install formidable package** for actual file uploads:
   ```bash
   npm install formidable
   ```

2. **Update upload.js API** to use the full formidable implementation (code already provided)

### Optional Enhancements
1. **Add download tracking** - Increment download count when files are accessed
2. **Add file deletion** - Currently only removes metadata, not actual files
3. **Add bulk upload** - Allow multiple files in one upload session
4. **Add file preview** - For supported formats
5. **Add email notifications** - When new documents are uploaded
6. **Add document versioning** - Track document revisions
7. **Add access restrictions** - Some documents for members only
8. **Add document search in content** - Full-text search within PDFs

## Testing
1. Navigate to `/admin/documents` (requires admin login)
2. View existing documents
3. Try search and filter functionality
4. Edit a document's metadata
5. Navigate to `/admin/documents/upload`
6. Try uploading a document (currently simulated)
7. Navigate to `/documents` (public page)
8. Browse and download documents

## Known Limitations
1. File uploads are currently simulated - install formidable for real uploads
2. No file size validation on client side
3. No progress indicator for uploads
4. No drag-and-drop upload support
