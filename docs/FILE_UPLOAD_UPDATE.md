# File Upload Implementation Update

## Changes Made

### 1. **Installed formidable package**
```bash
npm install formidable
```
- Version: 3.5.4
- Added to package.json dependencies
- Enables real file upload functionality

### 2. **Updated `/pages/api/admin/upload.js`**
- Replaced simulated upload with full formidable implementation
- Features:
  - Real file upload handling
  - 10MB file size limit
  - File type validation (PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Text, RTF)
  - Unique filename generation with timestamps
  - Error handling and cleanup
  - Security via JWT authentication

### 3. **File Upload Process**
1. User selects file on `/admin/documents/upload` page
2. File is sent to `/api/admin/upload` endpoint
3. formidable processes the file upload
4. File is saved to `/public/documents/` with unique name
5. Original filename and metadata are preserved
6. Response includes filename for database storage

### 4. **Supported File Types**
- PDF (`application/pdf`)
- Word Documents (`.doc`, `.docx`)
- Excel Spreadsheets (`.xls`, `.xlsx`)
- PowerPoint Presentations (`.ppt`, `.pptx`)
- Text Files (`.txt`)
- Rich Text Format (`.rtf`)

## Vercel Deployment

### Automatic Detection
- Vercel will automatically detect the package.json change
- formidable will be installed during the build process
- No additional configuration needed

### Deployment Process
1. Git push triggers Vercel webhook
2. Vercel pulls latest code
3. Runs `npm install` (includes formidable)
4. Builds the Next.js application
5. Deploys with full file upload capability

## Testing the Upload Feature

1. Login to admin panel
2. Navigate to `/admin/documents`
3. Click "Upload New Document"
4. Select a file (PDF, Word, Excel, etc.)
5. Fill in title, category, and description
6. Click "Upload Document"
7. File will be uploaded and saved
8. Document will appear in the documents list

## Security Considerations

- JWT authentication required for uploads
- File type validation prevents malicious files
- 10MB size limit prevents abuse
- Unique filenames prevent overwrites
- Special characters sanitized from filenames

## File Storage

- Files stored in: `/public/documents/`
- Naming pattern: `originalname_timestamp_random.extension`
- Example: `report_1704841732654_789.pdf`

## Next Deployment

The next Vercel deployment will include:
- formidable package installed
- Full file upload functionality
- All existing features remain intact

## Verification

To verify after deployment:
1. Check Vercel build logs for formidable installation
2. Test file upload in production
3. Verify uploaded files are accessible
4. Check document management functionality

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
- Previous deployment can be promoted in Vercel
- Git revert the commit if needed
- Simulated upload still available as fallback
