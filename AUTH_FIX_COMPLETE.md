# âœ… Fixed: Authentication Error in Upload

## The Issue
The upload and test endpoints were failing with "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'success')" because:
1. The endpoints were using `verifyToken(req)` expecting an object with `{success: boolean}`
2. But the actual `verifyToken` function only accepts a token string and returns the decoded token or null

## The Fix
Created a new function `verifyAdminAuth(req)` that:
1. Extracts the token from the Authorization header
2. Verifies the token
3. Returns `{success: boolean, user?: decoded}` format expected by the endpoints

## Files Updated
- `/lib/auth.js` - Added `verifyAdminAuth` function
- `/pages/api/admin/upload.js` - Updated to use `verifyAdminAuth`
- `/pages/api/admin/upload-test.js` - Updated to use `verifyAdminAuth`
- `/pages/api/admin/upload-simple.js` - Updated to use `verifyAdminAuth`
- `/pages/api/admin/documents.js` - Updated to use `verifyAdminAuth`

## Deploy Now
```bash
cd d:\dev2\pshcommitteesite
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix authentication in upload endpoints - use verifyAdminAuth"
git push
```

## Test After Deployment
1. Visit: https://psh-committee-site.vercel.app/upload-test-v2.html
2. Login with:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`
3. Click "Test Endpoint" - Should now work âœ…
4. Upload a file - Should now work âœ…

## Why This Fixes It
The authentication flow now works correctly:
1. Client sends: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
2. `verifyAdminAuth` extracts and verifies the token
3. Returns `{success: true, user: {...}}` on success
4. Endpoints can now properly check `authResult.success`

The upload functionality should now work properly! ðŸš€
