# Fixed: Dashboard Counts & Blob Warning

## Changes Made (June 25, 2025)

### 1. Removed Blob Storage Warning âœ…
**File**: `/pages/admin/documents.js`
- Removed the incorrect client-side check for `process.env.BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`
- The warning was showing even when blob storage was properly configured
- Since uploads are working, the warning was unnecessary

### 2. Fixed Dashboard Counts âœ…
**File**: `/pages/admin/dashboard.js`
- Replaced hardcoded placeholder values (12, 8, 45, 7)
- Now fetches real counts from each API endpoint:
  - **Blog Posts**: Calls `/api/admin/blog` and counts the posts
  - **Events**: Calls `/api/admin/events` and counts the events
  - **Submissions**: Calls `/api/admin/submissions` and counts submissions
  - **Documents**: Calls `/api/admin/documents` and counts documents
- Handles errors gracefully by showing 0 if API calls fail

## Deploy the Changes

```bash
cd d:\dev2\pshcommitteesite
git add -A
git commit -m "Remove blob warning and fix dashboard to show real counts"
git push
```

## What You'll See After Deployment

1. **No More Warning**: The blob storage warning will be gone from the documents page
2. **Real Counts**: The dashboard will show actual numbers:
   - Actual number of blog posts
   - Actual number of events
   - Actual number of form submissions
   - Actual number of documents

## How It Works

The dashboard now makes 4 API calls when it loads:
```javascript
GET /api/admin/blog       â†’ Count blog posts
GET /api/admin/events     â†’ Count events
GET /api/admin/submissions â†’ Count submissions
GET /api/admin/documents  â†’ Count documents
```

Each API returns the full list, and we count the array length to get the totals.

## Performance Note

Since the dashboard makes 4 API calls on load, there might be a slight delay before the numbers appear. The loading spinner will show during this time.

## Success Indicators

After deployment:
- âœ… No yellow warning box on documents page
- âœ… Dashboard shows real numbers instead of 12, 8, 45, 7
- âœ… Numbers update when you add/remove content

The dashboard will now always show accurate, up-to-date counts! ðŸŽ¯
