# UI/UX Improvements - Navigation & Document Preview

## Changes Made (June 25, 2025)

### 1. Navigation Bar Update ‚úÖ
**File**: `/components/AdminHeader.js`
- Changed "Upload Documents" to "Documents"
- Changed link from `/admin/documents/upload` to `/admin/documents`
- Now clicking "Documents" takes you to the document management page, not upload

### 2. Document Preview Feature ‚úÖ
**File**: `/pages/admin/documents/upload.js`
- Added a "Preview" button next to selected files
- When clicked, opens the file in a new tab
- Allows users to verify they selected the correct file before uploading
- Uses `URL.createObjectURL()` to create a temporary URL for the file
- Opens with `window.open(fileURL, '_blank')`

## How It Works

### Navigation Change
- The top navigation bar now shows "Documents" instead of "Upload Documents"
- Clicking it goes to the document management page where users can:
  - View all documents
  - Search/filter documents
  - Delete documents
  - Click "Upload Document" button to upload new ones

### Preview Feature
When a user selects a file for upload:
1. The file appears in a gray box showing filename and size
2. A "Preview" button appears on the right
3. Clicking "Preview" opens the file in a new browser tab
4. Users can verify it's the correct file
5. They can then close the preview tab and continue with upload

## Deploy the Changes

```bash
cd d:\dev2\pshcommitteesite
git add -A
git commit -m "Update nav to Documents and add file preview on upload"
git push
```

## What You'll See After Deployment

1. **Navigation Bar**: "Documents" instead of "Upload Documents"
2. **Document Upload Page**: Selected files will have a "Preview" button
3. **Preview Behavior**: Files open in new tab when preview is clicked

## Browser Compatibility Note

The preview feature works with most file types that browsers can display:
- ‚úÖ PDFs - Most browsers display PDFs natively
- ‚úÖ Images - JPG, PNG, GIF, etc.
- ‚úÖ Text files - TXT, CSV, etc.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Office files - May download instead of preview depending on browser

## User Experience Improvement

This change improves the workflow:
1. Users click "Documents" to see what's already uploaded
2. They can then click "Upload Document" if they need to add new ones
3. Before uploading, they can preview to ensure it's correct
4. No more accidentally uploading the wrong file!

Great suggestions for improving the user experience! üéØ
