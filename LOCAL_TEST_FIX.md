# âœ… Fixed: Local Testing Issue

## The Problem
You were running the test page locally (http://localhost:5500) but trying to call API endpoints that only exist on the deployed site.

## The Fix
Updated the test pages to always use the deployed API URL:
```javascript
const apiUrl = 'https://psh-committee-site.vercel.app';
```

## Test It Now (Without Deploying)

Since you're running the file locally, you can:

1. **Refresh your local page** (the one on localhost:5500)
2. Try logging in again with:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`

The page will now correctly call the deployed API endpoints.

## Alternative: Run Next.js Dev Server

If you want to test against local API endpoints:

```bash
cd d:\dev2\pshcommitteesite
npm run dev
```

Then visit: http://localhost:12500/upload-test-v2.html

## Quick Test in Console

You can also test directly in your browser console:

```javascript
fetch('https://psh-committee-site.vercel.app/api/auth/login', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  body: JSON.stringify({
    username: 'admin',
    password: 'admin123'
  })
}).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log);
```

This should now work! ðŸš€
